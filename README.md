# RootSneak

## Project Background and Motivation

In the Android ecosystem, Root access provides users with significant flexibility and control, but it also poses security risks and compatibility issues. Many applications detect Root status to prevent cheating or abuse. The `RootSneak` project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly solution that allows users to bypass these Root detection mechanisms while maintaining Root functionality.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Configuration**: Automatically downloads and configures Magisk modules to hide Root status.
- **Multi-Version Support**: Supports multiple Magisk versions, including Magisk Alpha, Magisk Kitsune Mask, APatch, and KernelSU.
- **No Manual Intervention**: The script handles all configurations automatically; users do not need to intervene manually.

## Installation Steps

1. **Confirm Device Root Status**: Ensure your device is already rooted and using one of the supported versions.
2. **Download the Script**: Download the `RootSneak` script.
3. **Copy and Grant Permissions**: Copy the script to an executable path on your device and grant it execution permissions.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to automatically download and configure the necessary modules to hide Root.

## Custom Configuration

The `RootSneak` script supports basic custom configurations. You can adjust the module download links or other settings by editing the configuration file within the script or by executing configuration commands.

## Version Update Log

- **2024-10-27**: Added support for KernelSU.
- **2024-09-15**: Optimized the script's automatic download and configuration process.

## Testing and Verification

After running the script, you can use various tools to verify whether the Root status has been successfully hidden.
