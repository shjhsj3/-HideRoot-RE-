# Current Work Progress

## Current Progress

### 1. Plan Implementation Method
- **Completed**:
  - Collected numerous schemes for hiding ROOT traces.
  - Selected the best scheme.
- **In Progress**:
  - Expanding the schemes to increase options and compatibility with more models.

### 2. User Interface Design
- **Completed**:
  - Completed the preliminary design of the user interface, including the main interface and settings interface.
  - Conducted user testing, collected feedback, and made preliminary improvements.
- **In Progress**:
  - Conducting the integration of UI with functionality.
  - Optimizing the user interface to enhance user experience.
  - Planning to introduce multi-language support, currently working on translation.

### 3. Functional Modules
- **Completed**:
  - Download logic completed.
  - Installation splicing completed.
- **In Progress**:
  - Conducting stability testing and fixing known bugs.
  - Planning to introduce new calculation methods.
  - APatch KPM installation scheme.

## Next Steps
- **Hiding Scheme**:
  - Complete the expansion and annotation of hiding schemes.
  - Start algorithm optimization.
- **Functionality**:
  - Complete system stability testing and bug fixing.
- **User Interface Design**:
  - Complete the optimization of the user interface and multi-language support.
  - Conduct final user testing, collect feedback, and make final improvements.

## Issues and Challenges
- **Hiding Scheme**:
  - Complexity makes it difficult for a single person to organize stable hiding schemes in a short time.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Variations in root managers make it difficult to ensure calculation accuracy.
- **Functionality**:
  - Some bugs discovered during system stability testing are hard to reproduce.
  - Embedding KPM design is quite complex.
- **User Interface Design**:
  - The optimization of the user interface is time-consuming and slow.
  - The translation work for multi-language support is extensive and slow.

## Summary
The project is progressing smoothly, with each module proceeding according to plan. Although some challenges have been encountered in areas such as user interface design, the team is actively addressing them and making progress. The next step will be to continue advancing the work of each module to ensure the project is completed on time.
